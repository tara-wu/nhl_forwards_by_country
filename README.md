# nhl_forwards_by_country
This script uses ArcGIS Pro to filter current NHL players born in a specified country (default: Sweden) who play forward positions. It creates separate shapefiles for each forward position, and calculates player height and weight in metric units (cm/kg).

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Extract the contents and open ArcGIS Pro or the ArcGIS Pro Python Command Prompt.
3. Update the workspace path in the script to point to the `/data` folder.
4. Run the script to generate three shapefiles (one for each forward position).
